# Emergency Fund Modeling with NFCS Data

## Project Overview

This project uses data from the 2021 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) to model the likelihood that an individual has an emergency fund covering at least three months of expenses. The goal is to identify key financial, behavioral, and demographic predictors of short-term financial resilience.

Understanding which populations are more or less financially prepared can inform policy decisions, financial education programs, and outreach strategies, particularly in light of rising economic uncertainty and inflation.

## Objective

To build a logistic regression model that predicts whether an individual has an emergency fund based on their income, education, debt levels, budgeting behaviors, and other personal characteristics.

## Key Questions

1. Which personal and financial factors are most predictive of emergency fund adequacy?
2. How do budgeting behaviors and financial habits affect preparedness?
3. Are certain demographic or income groups disproportionately unprepared?
4. Can we classify individuals into "prepared" vs. "unprepared" categories with useful accuracy?

## Hypotheses

1. Higher income and education levels increase the likelihood of having emergency savings.
2. Positive financial behaviors, like budgeting and regular saving, are strongly associated with preparedness.
3. Indicators of financial strain, e.g. missed bills, credit card debt, reduce the probability of having a 3-month cushion.

## Project Structure

Organized the project into six R notebooks covering:

1. Project overview,
2. Financial literacy score,
3. Data load and transformation,
4. Exploratory data analysis,
5. Modeling, and
6. Reporting and visualizations.
